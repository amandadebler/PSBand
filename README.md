Howdy, y'all - welcome to PSBand!

To get started, you'll definitely need to install the Microsoft Band Sync client on your PC - that's the easiest way to get the necessary DLLs if you're not using Visual Studio.

It would also be good to have a Microsoft Band for testing, but there is at least one issue that I need a .Net developer to help with: I have not been able to make a BandTile, which requires turning an image file into a System.Windows.Media.Imaging.WriteableBitmap, one 24x24 and one 46x46.
